# Pie Chart with Matplotlib
Pie charts are used to visually represent data that can be divided into categories or segments that make up a whole. They are particularly useful when you want to show the relative size or proportion of each category in the data set.

Topics I Cover :

 - Custom Color
 - Auto-label slices
 - Swap label and autopct text positions
 - Explode, shade, and rotate slices
